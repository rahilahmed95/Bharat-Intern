# Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! This repository features three web development projects:

- [Portfolio Website](#portfolio-website)
- [Temperature Converter](#temperature-converter)
- [Netflix Homepage Clone](#netflix-homepage-clone)

## Portfolio Website

Visit my personal website to learn more about me, my skills, and my projects. This site showcases my web development skills and design sensibilities. Explore the code and live demo [here](link_to_portfolio).

## Temperature Converter

A simple web application that allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It's a practical utility for everyday temperature conversions. Try it out [here](link_to_temperature_converter).

## Netflix Homepage Clone

Ever wondered how to create a clone of the Netflix homepage? I've recreated it to demonstrate my ability to replicate complex web layouts and UI components. Check out the demo [here](link_to_netflix_clone).

Feel free to explore each project's source code and the live demos. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
